journal that saves info locally on your device and not in the cloud.
originally written and tested by me, Edward Lee Neeley III - written and tested offline first.
Tested online on laptop through duckduckgo browser and still works to allow user to save data entries locally on their personal device. Export button saves .json file locally to storage and import button pulls up the .json files as well.
tested on mobile android phone as well - 2 tests separately. 1 on duckduckgo browser and 1 on google browser
duckduckgo browser (android) works just as intended. when saving files, they remain. using export button does nothing because of browser function does not supports blobs for downloads. import works. but if you close the web page and reopen it, it pulls all information right back up again.
opening on google browser ( android) works perfectly and supports blob downloads so you an save entries and use export button to save .json files/ user entries to your device/phone. import button allows you to go to device storage and find the .json file immediately and pull it up.
dates and times are used for sorting through entries. works across all devices.
privacy centered, offline first, no microfinger printing, free with no login, local storage without cloud based tie ins.
will be added to a larger part of what im working on currently at a later time. just wanted it to be online for now for portfolio purposes for looking for junior front end developer work.
Praise God!
