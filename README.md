Journal App – Edward Lee Neeley III

A privacy-centered journal that saves information locally on your device, not in the cloud.

Overview:

Built and tested offline first, then tested online on a laptop (DuckDuckGo browser).

Works across devices: desktop and mobile (Android).

Allows users to save entries locally without login, cloud storage, or microfingerprinting.

Entries remain even after closing the webpage — localStorage ensures data persistence.

Features:

Export entries: Saves a .json file locally (supported in browsers with blob downloads, e.g., Chrome).

Import entries: Allows users to load .json files from device storage.

Timeline: Dates and times are used for sorting entries, displayed in an easy-to-read format.

Responsive design: Works on both desktop and mobile screens.

Testing Notes:

DuckDuckGo browser (Android): Offline saving works, import works, export limited by browser.

Google Chrome (Android): Full functionality — export and import work perfectly.

Additional Info:

Privacy-first, offline-first, free, no login required.

Designed as part of a larger system to be integrated later.

Hosted online for portfolio purposes to showcase front-end development skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, localStorage, responsive design, and DOM manipulation.

Praise God! 🙏❤️
